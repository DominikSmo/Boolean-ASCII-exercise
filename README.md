# Finding the numeric values of some letters from ASCII table

This program includes two methods. First of them looks for numeric equivalents from the ASCII table of three letters which are stored in an array. 
Then it matches each of them boolean value true or false.

Then the second method finds the numbers of indices from an array where are stored numeric equivalents from the ASCII table of the given letters in the exercise.
